Maintainable Material Should:
* Be customizable **per delivery**
* Accept updates across **all courses**
* Encourage collaboration

Book:

We want to be able to easily customize deliveries for a specific client.  In addition we want to be able
when we're preparing for a delivery to make changes to the main course that automatically come into the
delivery branch.  This follows a typical flow for git in software projects.  We'd never let someone
create branches of a software projects in different folders, why would we do this with our courses?

Good maintainable material should also be easy to push now updates to.  If we change logos, or have a
designer update the colours and styles we use, we want to push these improvements to all of our courses.

Finally we want our maintainable material to encourage us to work together.  The best way to drive
improvements to our courses is the same way we would in software, to make the source available and invite
pull requests to the course that the *course owner* can accept/reject/comment on.
