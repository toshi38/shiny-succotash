## Material **vs** Slides

Book:

We've had a never ending discussion among Edument's teachers.  Are we building course materials for
in the course, for after the course, or for both?

How much should material be able to stand on its own after we leave the classroom?

### Slides **first**
Prioritize **slides** over printed materials

Book:

When we prioritize slides first we have slides that are more minimalistic requiring a teacher to explain
them.  These slides often look better and can include things like transitions, and animations to help
us explain our point.

With these *pretty* slides comes an issue.  When we print them into books, students need to make sure
they're writing a lot of notes in class if they want the material to be of value afterwards.  In addition
things like transitions are very hard to print!

### Material **first**
Prioritizing **printed materials** over slides

Book:

Some courses tended to have slides with a _wall of text_ on them.  These sorts of slides where great for
students to read after the course, and made it easier to hand courses over between teachers.

Unfortunately they're also not as nice to look at, lead to students reading the slide instead of
listening to the teacher and sometimes lead to the teachers reading from the slides instead of delivering
the material directly.
