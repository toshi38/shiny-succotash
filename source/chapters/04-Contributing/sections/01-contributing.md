### File bugs for issues:

We hope that you enjoy using MC2 but we of course know there are more bugs.  Feel free to file these bugs
directly in jira so that we can track, prioritize, and fix them.

### Improve Documentation
[MC2 Confluence](https://edument.atlassian.net/wiki/display/EM/Emcee+Home)

Book:
Getting started there is still a bit of a learning curve.  We have some ideas to improve this like being
able to generate an empty course.  In the mean time feel free to help contribute documentation.
